# Solar System Visualization: A 2D Dynamic Model of Planetary Orbits

## Project Overview

The *Solar System Visualization* project simulates the orbits of the planets in our solar system in 2D space. The simulation visually represents planetary movement based on orbital parameters such as radius and speed, allowing users to observe the motion of planets around the Sun. The simulation is built using Python and visualized using the `matplotlib` library, with additional use of `numpy` for numerical calculations.

### Key Features:
- Real-time simulation of planetary orbits
- User-adjustable orbital speed via a slider
- Visualization of the solar system with planetary orbits
- Interactive user interface with zoom, pan, and speed controls
- Accurate representations of planetary positions and distances

## Requirements

Before running this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy
- ipywidgets (for interactive controls)

You can install the necessary libraries by running:

pip install matplotlib numpy ipywidgets

To run the solar system simulation:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-system-visualization.git
Navigate into the project directory:



cd solar-system-visualization
Run the script:


python solar_system_simulation.py
This will open a window with the visualization of the solar system. The planets will begin to orbit the Sun, and you can interact with the simulation.
